This is APAN, Advanced Performance Addon for Nagios.

Version 0.3.0-sql

Introduction ----------------------------------------

Apan is a addon to Nagios that is used to collect results from Nagios
plugins and store it in RRD-files. You can the use Apan to view graphs
of the data in Nagios web-interface.

This version of Apan uses a MySQL-database to store its _configuration_.
The table-structure is simple and there should be no big problems to
port it to another database (look in sql.conf for hints).

Why did I change from text-files to SQL?

Here are some of the reasons:

- Its much easier to write a config-tool.
- Handling of parameters between the main program and the plugins is easier
- There is no need for the array with color-strings which caused a lot of
  problems in some shells. I think Apan now should run under a pure
  bourne-shell, but I haven't tested it...
- Performance? Hard to say. The overall load on my machine increased with
  ~0.5, because of all calls to MySQL. But the check-duration have decreased
  a little because you don't have to parse a 500-lines text-file on every call.
  I think you will gain performance in a large environment. Especially if
  you take some time and tune MySQL, or move it to a separate machine.


System Requirements ---------------------------------

To use this package you need Nagios (www.nagios.org), RRD-Tool
(http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool/), MySQL (www.mysql.com),
a bourne-shell compatible UNIX-shell and the bc-command.

Changes ---------------------------------------------

* Configuration is stored in a MySQL-database

* Apan uses one extinfo-file

* apanconf-sql, a simple ui that can be used to configure apanservices
  See README.apanconf for more info.

* Some new and some changed plugins

Installation ----------------------------------------

Here is a short install-howto, for more info you should look at
apan.sourceforge.net:

1)  Unpack the distribution in Nagios base-directory (/usr/local/nagios)

2)  Check that the file apan-sql.sh and the files in the directory plugs-sql is
    executable by the Nagios-user.

3)  Update the path's and vars in apan.defs. If you are installing apan
    in a different location than /usr/local/nagios/apan-sql, then you have
    to edit apan-sql.sh, apan-sql.cgi, generate-sql.cgi and apanconfig-sql as well.

4)  Update sql.conf

5)  Check the parameters in the script createdb.sh and run it to create the
    needed database-tables.

6)  If you are upgrading from an older text-based Apan installation you can use the
    script import.sh to import the existing configuration into the database;
    - check the parameters at the beginning of the script.
    - Run the script and look for errors.

7)  Copy apan-sql.cgi and generate-sql.cgi to Nagios cgi-bin directory
    (/usr/local/nagios/sbin), and make them executable by the web-server.

8)  Copy the graph-icon, graph.png, to Nagios logo-directory
    (/usr/local/nagios/share/images/logos).

9)  Link or copy the contributed plugins from apan's libexec-dir to Nagios
    libexec-dir

10)  Add apan-sql.sh to checkcommands.cfg;
	define command {
	command_name                   apan-sql
	command_line                   /usr/local/nagios/apan-sql/apan-sql.sh $ARG1$ $HOSTNAME$ "$SERVICEDESC$" $TIMET$ $ARG2$ $ARG3$
	}

11)  Add sevices to nagios;
	define service {
	host_name                      host1,host2
	service_description            Disk-usage
	check_command                  apan-sql!nt-disk!150!100
	use                            generic-test
	normal_check_interval          5
}

12) Add the hosts/services to the database, create RRD-files and servicextinfo.
    See README.apanconf for more info.

13) Add the serviceextinfo-file to nagios cgi.cfg. The filename should be the
    the same as EXTINFOFILE in apanconf.defs;
	xedtemplate_config_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/servicextinfo-apan

14) Start Nagios and enjoy..
